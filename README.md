# Employee-Attrition
 Project : Employee Attrition Prediction : This project aims to predict employee attrition using machine learning techniques. It helps organizations identify employees at risk of leaving, enabling proactive measures to improve retention.
 
Key aspects:

Data preprocessing: Clean and prepare employee data for model training.
Feature engineering: Extract meaningful features from the data to improve model performance.
Model development and evaluation: Explore and compare various machine learning algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest) to predict employee churn. Evaluate model performance using relevant metrics.


Programming languages : Python
Machine learning libraries : scikit-learn
